- [Unified Service Tagging](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/unified_service_tagging/?tab=kubernetes#overview) powers the correlation capability of Datadog. 
- [Line 5-7](https://github.com/jon94/eval-dd-poc/blob/main/APM%20Instrumentation/Java/sample-deployment.yaml#L5-L7) and Line [39-41](https://github.com/jon94/eval-dd-poc/blob/main/APM%20Instrumentation/Java/sample-deployment.yaml#L39-L41)
